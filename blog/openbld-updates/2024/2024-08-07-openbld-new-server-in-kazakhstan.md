![OpenBLD.net - New Server in Kazakhstan](images/openbld-new-server-in-kazakhstan.jpg)

I hear a lot of good reviews from people about the new Yandex cloud in Kazakhstan 🇰🇿. And so, having saved up some money and received a small deposit from Yandex, I decided to try the cloud.

Starting today, a new server has appeared in Karaganda, which will enter the general OpenBLD.net ecosystem in the next 24 hours.

I really hope that this step will help improve the service, speed up the work of DoH and DoT clients of the capital of the Kazakhstan region and Central Kazakhstan as a whole.

Let's go further in a good mood and faith in success 💪

You can find out how to connect to the service on the project [homepage](https://openbld.net).
