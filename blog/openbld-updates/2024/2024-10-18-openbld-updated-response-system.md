![OpenBLD.net presents: New Guaranteed Response System](images/openbld-updated-response-system.png)

Have you ever faced issues with receiving responses from servers? Timeouts, errors, or empty replies can significantly disrupt some workflows. But I tried, and I think I found a solution!

🟩 The new OpenBLD.net feature includes a guaranteed response system that activates in cases where the standard resolution process fails. If you receive a Servfail status or other errors, we employ additional logic, and the service takes a:

- Internal pool of servers.
- External pool of servers.

By mixing  both, we ensure unique servers without upstreams that returned a fail status or are busy.

This means that even if the initial response was unsuccessful, we continue the search for the correct answer, ensuring reliability and accuracy for you.

Don’t let response issues slow down your life or business!

Be yourself, be focused! ✌️
