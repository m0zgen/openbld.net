🚀 OpenBLD.net new DNS server in Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 Almaty

Recently learned about 3hcloud.kz. Went, tried it and was pleasantly surprised:

- speed (connectivity and instances are super)
- liked the firewall
- prices were pleasantly surprising

After several weeks of testing, I can firmly say - compatibility with OpenBLD.net is present.

Configure Chrome as described here:

- How-to set up your favorite [Browser](/docs/get-started/setup-browsers/chrome/)

And then open the site that got you with ads and be surprised yourself.

P.S. There is a case or something does not work - welcome at any time (contacts)

P.P.S. Yandex Cloud unfortunately turned out to be incompatible with OpenBLD.net quality requirements, all servers based on this cloud will be abolished in the near future ⚰️
