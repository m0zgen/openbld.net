### [3HCLOUD.kz](https://3hcloud.kz/)- Supports OpenBLD.net

I’m happy to announce that thanks to [3hcloud.kz](https://3hcloud.kz/), new DNS and Cache servers have been launched in Almaty!

The cloud impressed us with its speeds, hardware, and eagerness to meet the needs of clients and potential partners. 

Servers are currently being prepared in Europe (Poland), with plans for the Philippines and the USA to follow.

These ambitious plans will be realized one way or another, but with [3HCLOUD](https://3hcloud.kz/), I’m confident they will happen faster 🚀

Thank you to all the loyal cloud and hosting companies supporting the OpenBLD.net project. Together, we can make this world more cyber hygienic and secure. 🛡️

Wishing everyone well! ✌️
